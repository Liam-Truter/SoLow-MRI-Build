# Measurement Info
## Conventions
### Bore orientation
G_z+ pointing up
X down the bore
Y to the left facing down the bore
Z up
### Magnetic field probe
Bx pointing towards bore Z
By pointing towards negative bore Y
Bz pointing towards bore X
### Mapping
Gradients are measured along the radius starting at -r passing through the center at 0 and ending at r. The convention for measurement. The angles go from 90 to -45 anticlockwise around the x axis on the YZ plane. 90 degrees is vertical (-Z to +Z) and 0 degrees is horizontal (-Y to Y).
